# pub-sub-model
I've created this pub-sub model with TypeScript while learning TypeScript

Pub/Sub, as it is often called, works like this: a publisher (i.e. any source of data) pushes messages out to interested subscribers (i.e. receivers of data) via live-feed data streams known as channels (or topics). All subscribers to a specific publisher channel are immediately notified when new messages have been published on that channel, and the message data (or payload) is received together with the notification.
